# Depression-Anxiety-and-Stress-detection

Detecting depression, anxiety, and stress is crucial for addressing the high prevalence of mental disorders. Previous studies relied only on the questions of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) dataset and predict using different machine learning algorithms. This research aims to enhance the efficiency and realism of the model and dataset by incorporating additional features and questions from the World Health Organization (WHO) website into the DASS 42 dataset. Machine learning techniques such as RBF with SVM, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are employed to predict the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. By integrating new elements, a wider range of mental health factors and symptoms are considered, enabling better capture of the complexities of mental disorders. The study focuses on improving predictive accuracy through an expanded dataset and advanced machine learning methods, providing a more efficient and realistic approach to detecting depression, anxiety, and stress. These findings contribute to the field of mental health research and diagnosis, offering valuable insights into the integration of additional features and questions with advanced machine learning algorithms.
